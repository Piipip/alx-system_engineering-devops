# Postmortem Report

## Service Outage on June 10, 2024

### Incident Report for [Service Outage](https://example.com/incident-report)

#### Summary

On June 10, 2024, from 3:00 PM to 5:15 PM GMT, our primary web application experienced an outage, resulting in approximately 85% of users being unable to access the service. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer following a routine update, which led to improper traffic routing and server overload.

#### Timeline

- 3:00 PM GMT - Monitoring alert indicated a sudden spike in server errors.
- 3:02 PM GMT - On-call engineer confirms the issue and begins initial investigation.
- 3:05 PM GMT - Issue escalated to the DevOps team as the primary web application is down.
- 3:10 PM GMT - DevOps team investigates server logs and suspects a database connectivity issue.
- 3:20 PM GMT - Initial hypothesis debunked; database appears healthy and operational.
- 3:30 PM GMT - Network team checks for potential DDoS attack; no unusual traffic detected.
- 3:45 PM GMT - Closer inspection of load balancer settings reveals recent configuration changes.
- 4:00 PM GMT - Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the likely root cause.
- 4:15 PM GMT - Configuration rolled back to pre-update state.
- 4:30 PM GMT - Services gradually begin to recover.
- 5:00 PM GMT - Full functionality restored and verified across the user base.
- 5:15 PM GMT - Official end of the incident declared.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. A recent update introduced a configuration change that incorrectly routed traffic, causing certain servers to become overloaded while others received no traffic. This imbalance led to server crashes and widespread service unavailability.

The resolution involved rolling back the load balancer configuration to its previous state before the update. This action redistributed the traffic evenly across all servers, allowing them to recover from the overload and resume normal operations. Additional testing confirmed that the load balancer was functioning correctly before declaring the incident resolved.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

* Improvements/Fixes:
1. Load Balancer Configuration Management:
   - Implement stricter version control and automated testing for load balancer configurations.
2. Enhanced Monitoring:
   - Increase granularity of monitoring on load balancer traffic distribution and server load to detect imbalances sooner.
3. Incident Response Training:
   - Conduct training sessions for engineering and DevOps teams on identifying and responding to load balancer issues.

* Tasks:
1. Patch Load Balancer Software:
   - Ensure all updates are thoroughly tested in a staging environment before deployment.
2. Add Monitoring:
   - Integrate advanced monitoring tools to alert for traffic routing anomalies and server overloads.
3. Update Documentation:
   - Revise the configuration management documentation to include new checks and balances.
4. Conduct a Postmortem Meeting:
   - Review the incident with all relevant teams to discuss what went wrong and how to improve the process.
5. Implement Automation:
   - Develop automation scripts for rolling back to previous configurations swiftly in case of future issues.
